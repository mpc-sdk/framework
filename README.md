# Polysig

Polysig is a library for single-party and multisig use cases for ECDSA, Schnorr and Ed25519 signature schemes.

We refer to single-party implementations as *signers* and multisig as *protocols*; all of the multisig *protocols* are threshold signature schemes. Supported protocols are [FROST][] and [CGGMP21][].

Protocols communicate via an end-to-end encrypted relay server using the [noise protocol][] and websockets for the transport layer or if you already have a transport you can use the [driver](/crates/driver) crate directly.

The library includes bindings for Webassembly to be used in the browser and for Nodejs; for multisig protocols the client implementation uses [web-sys][] for webassembly and [tokio-tungstenite][] for other platforms.

## Features

* `full` Enable all protocols and signers (default).
* `protocols` Enable all protocols.
* `signers` Enable all signers.

### Protocols

* `cggmp`: Enable the [CGGMP21][] protocol using [synedrion](https://docs.rs/synedrion/).
* `frost-ed25519`: Enable the [FROST][] Ed25519 protocol using  [frost-ed25519](https://docs.rs/frost-ed25519/).

### Signers

* `ecdsa`: Signer compatible with Ethereum using [k256](https://docs.rs/k256/latest/k256/).
* `eddsa`: Signer compatible with Solana using [ed25519](https://docs.rs/ed25519/latest/ed25519/) and [ed25519-dalek](https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/latest/ed25519_dalek/).
* `schnorr`: Signer compatible with Bitcoin Taproot (BIP-340) using [k256](https://docs.rs/k256/latest/k256/).

## Meeting Rooms

For protocols to be executed the participants need to exchange public key information. To facilitate this we provide the [meeting-server][] which allows for meeting rooms to be created and all participants to be notified once all public keys are available. The client library provides [high-level functions](https://docs.rs/polysig-client/latest/polysig_client/meeting/index.html) for creating and joining rooms. These functions are also exposed in the bindings.

The [meeting-server][] is intentionally distinct from the [relay-server][] so the relay server has no knowledge of the public key exchange.

There are two identifiers for meeting rooms the `MeetingId` and a `UserId` for each participant. The `UserId` is a 32-byte identifier which is typically generated using a hash (such as SHA256) of some unique information. The information could be the participant's email address or other unique identifier.

The creator of the meeting room submits all the user identifiers (including their own) and the server will assign slots and return a `MeetingId`.

The meeting room creator then needs to share the `MeetingId` and each participant's assigned `UserId` with each of the participants. Typically this would be done in the form of a URL.

All participants must then join the meeting room using their assigned slot (usually via a URL link) and publish their public keys to the server. Each participant must share both the `public_key` which is the public key for the noise protocol and the `verifying_key` which is used to verify authenticity when exchanging protocol round messages.

Once all participants have joined the room the server will send a broadcast notification including all the participant identifiers and public keys.

Now the participants are ready to begin executing a protocol session.

## Server Installation

```
cargo install polysig-relay
```

## Development

### Getting Started

You will need the [rust][] toolchain and a few other tools:

```
cargo install cargo-hack
cargo install cargo-make
cargo install cargo-nextest
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Minimum supported rust version (MSRV) is 1.68.1.

Run the `gen-keys` task to setup keypairs for the server and test specs:

```
cargo make gen-keys
```

### Server

Start a server:

```
cargo run -- start config.toml
```

### Documentation

```
cargo make doc
```

### Tests

To run the tests using the native client:

```
cargo make test
```

For webassembly and node binding tests see the README files in the conformance directory.
